# Pomodoro Timer

This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#scaffolding-your-first-vite-project).

This is a pomodoro timer project that I used to re-learn React after a while, so I don't get rusty.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run test`

Launches the test runner for unit testing.

### `npm run format`

Launches the ESLint and Prettier runner to lint the code against AirBnb ruleset and reformat it
with Prettier.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html) for more information.
